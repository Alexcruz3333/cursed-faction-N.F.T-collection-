# This is a placeholder for the Unity package file
# The actual .unitypackage file would be created by Unity's Package Manager
# and would contain all the compiled scripts, prefabs, and assets

# To create the actual package:
# 1. In Unity, select Assets > Export Package
# 2. Select all files in the PiggyBankNFT folder
# 3. Export as "PiggyBankNFT-Unity.unitypackage"
# 4. This creates a distributable package file

# Package contents would include:
# - Scripts/ (all C# scripts)
# - Prefabs/ (UI prefabs and game objects)
# - Materials/ (materials for effects)
# - Audio/ (sound effects and music)
# - Textures/ (icons and UI elements)
# - Documentation/ (README and guides)
